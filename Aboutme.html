<h3>Happy Man</h3>
<p>
    If I was the superhero, the power I would want is the ability to make
     people happy. No superhero I've heard of can do that. Making people 
     happy is a unique ability, and it could change the world. It could stop
     violence, drugs, and suicide. What I mean by that is this: If people 
     were happy, they would not even want to kill people. Also, people 
     usually take drugs to feel better.

    built into Vim.[45] Based on the ex editor language of the original 
    vi editor, early versions of Vim added commands for control flow and 
    function definitions.
